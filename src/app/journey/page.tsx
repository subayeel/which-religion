              There are many such innate desires that are common among humans,
              regardless of their location or mentality. My argument is that
              these innate feelings and the motivation to bring peace and
              prosperity into one's life led to the creation of communities,
              groups of people living together and supporting one another.
              However, this can sometimes become problematic, leading to the
              need for rules, which were established by the responsible members
              of the community.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              While I have mentioned the positive desires of humans, the issue
              arises with desires that drive individuals to break the rules set
              by the community, for example, the desire for power, respect, and
              wealth. These lead to many problems. Communities become divided
              over which rules are best, and eventually, a single community
              splits into multiple parts.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              This gives rise to different countries, languages, philosophies,
              religions, castes, and so on. Each group believes they are on the
              right path. This belief continues for generations. A child follows
              the path of the parent, and the biases instilled in the child's
              mind become so deeply rooted that it becomes almost impossible for
              them to question their inherited way of life.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Differences in customs, rituals, ethics, and rules can coexist.
              However, the consequence of this is subjective morality, which
              history has repeatedly shown cannot truly coexist. Time and again,
              one group declares war on another because they disagree on moral
              grounds. Each person believes their version of morality is true,
              often worsening the situation, whether due to negative desires or
              not.

              The question remains: What breaks this loop? What is that one

              systems to coexist despite the historical divisions in society?
              What can solve modern problems like obesity, poverty, organized
              crime, general crime, drugs, public obscenity, and the
              degeneration of the entertainment industry? What can offer
              sustainable economic development without infringing on personal
              freedom? What can ensure a proper division of duties between the

              This is the Line of Existence. If you are a person of knowledge,
              you will be able to understand exactly where there is chaos and
              where there is order.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Let me elaborate further: On the Existence Line, if we go before
              Human, we see order, constants, and systems that work well
              together. Similarly, if we go after Country, we see stability.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              The stability and constants found in those parts of the Existence
              Line are so perfect and detailed that humans have convinced
              themselves there must be a designer behind them. It is common
              sense to conclude the existence of a designer after seeing a
              perfect design. Thus, we have multiple religions and philosophies,
              each claiming they have a message from this designer.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              But why is this notion important for our discussion, where we are
              trying to figure out a stable system? It is important because, if
              you observe the Existence Line once more, the place where there is
              chaos needs a proper system. So, if such a designer does exist,
              then it must have provided the ideal system.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Crossroads</h2>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Now, we are at a thrilling yet daunting crossroads, forced to
              examine the systems and religions that dominate the 21st century.
              The stakes are high, and the complexity is staggering.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              To truly grasp the matter, we must plunge fearlessly into the
              depths of existing systems that attempt to answer life's most
              profound questions, religions and philosophies. But in 2025, the
              challenge is greater than ever. The rigid separation of religion
              and state adds layers of complexity, and the modern trend of
              portraying religion as nothing more than "backward thinking" has
              created a hostile climate. These attitudes don't just discourage
              open dialogue, they actively choke the oxygen needed for unbiased,
              honest research.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Still, we must proceed. First, we will explore religions broadly,
              then compare them, and finally, take a deep dive into the one that
              offers the most relevant and sustainable framework for the world
              of 2025.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              But even if we discover the "right" religion or philosophy, our
              work doesn't end there. We will have to scour history for examples
              of systems that were successfully woven into everyday life,
              systems that genuinely solved the issues of chaos and instability
              outlined earlier. And this will not be easy, because the current
              global framework, often referred to as the "New World Order," has
              been masterful at burying or erasing any competing alternative
              before it has the chance to take root. This is not just research,
              it's a battle for truth under layers of suppression.

              After looking into human history, we find that our recorded data

              have walked this planet for 200,000â€“300,000 years, according to
              fossil evidence. For that vast prehistoric span, we have no
              written records, no clear window into how our ancestors lived,

              in the name of "development."

                These are only a fraction of the problems, yet they are enough
                for any rational human â€” or even an AGI â€” to see: the collapse
                of this "New World Order" is happening before our eyes. Time is
                running out.

              The so-called leaders â€” presidents, prime ministers, ministers â€”
              are pawns in a much larger game. Many of them may not even
              understand who the real players are. But one truth is certain:
              illusions don't last forever. When they fall, the truth will come
              out â€” revealing who were the architects of chaos and who were the
              peacemakers.

              But here lies the challenge: How can a single citizen fight a

              17th century?
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              To answer this, we must go back and examine how the New World
              Order took root â€” piece by piece â€” between the 17th and 21st
              centuries.

              The Rise of the New World Order
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Looking back over the last two millennia, humanity witnessed
              staggering developments, technology, governance systems, medicine,
              political structures, industrial growth, and deeper understanding
              of the natural world through biology, chemistry, physics, and
              mathematics.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Knowledge became the catalyst for technological leaps and better
              living standards. But these gains came at a heavy cost: two
              catastrophic World Wars (1914â€“1945). These wars, while
              destructive, also accelerated advancements in medicine,
              engineering, and communication.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              In their aftermath, the post-war international order emerged,
              building institutions like the United Nations, WHO, and IMF,
              bodies intended to stabilize global relations, though not without
              bias or hidden agendas.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              The advent of nuclear weapons reshaped geopolitics. Fear of mutual
              annihilation forced superpowers to negotiate rather than escalate,
              preventing another world war. Large-scale violence declined, but
              small-scale conflicts never vanished.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              The discovery of antibiotics dramatically improved public health.
              Meanwhile, the discovery of crude oil, though sparking
              resource-driven wars, especially in the Middle East, fueled the
              internal combustion engine, revolutionizing transportation and
              industry.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              The industrial age transformed work life, drawing masses into
              factories. Later, the advent of the Internet shattered
              communication barriers and democratized access to information.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              These factors undeniably improved life, better health, political
              stability, organized governance, and technological abundance. Yet,
              success came with its own trap: the population boom. Longer
              lifespans and fewer conflicts swelled human numbers, demanding new
              food systems. The Green Revolution answered with high-yield crops,
              synthetic fertilizers, and mechanization.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              But beneath these visible changes, hidden structural shifts were
              being engineered, often unnoticed amidst the noise of wars and
              innovation:

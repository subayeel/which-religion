                Module 1: The need for Anchor points
              </h1>

              <p className="mb-8">
                In this journey, we are are going for observation on every
                level. And of course, for every observation to take place we
                need a point of reference. In this journey, these points of
                reference should be an objective so that a human from every
                corner of the world can resonate with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                And those anchors which will always keep your mindset grounded
                to reality are following:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-decimal ml-8">
                <li>
                  <strong>Birth:</strong> You had a beginning in this world just
                  like everything in this world had a beginning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Death:</strong> You will be forgotten in 100 years
                  from now.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Human Innate Disposition:</strong> These dispositions
                  are present in every human beings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Existence:</strong> You exist in this world, others
                  also exist, this is not an illusion. Your intentions,actions
                  and goals have consequences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time:</strong> Time flows in one direction and it does
                  not stop and it cannot be reversed.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The state of desperation during the sail increases every second
                with the limited supply of food, increasing thirst, and the fear
                of storms, which compels you to find the right direction to
                navigate.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The objective from here onwards will be finding navigation in
                this life. The sailor will use stars at night to navigate and

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Before we begin our observations, let's take a deep dive into
                each anchor we listed, so that our hearts and minds are in sync,
                which is required to understand the upcoming text.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                These 2 anchors need no more clarity: your birth and your death,
                as there is no person in this world who has doubts regarding
                this. Let's dive into the other 3 anchors: understanding and
                validating their authenticity to such a degree that our minds
                understand the concept and our hearts accept it without a shred
                of doubt.

                Everyone has their own goals and objectives in life, but these

                However, there are certain things that are common to all of us.

              <p className="mb-8">
                For example, a mother's love for her child, the attraction

                      cultural, religious, and political boundaries. These

                This is the Line of Existence. If you are a person of knowledge,
                you will be able to understand exactly where there is chaos and
                where there is order.

                On the Existence Line, the components above Human and after
                Country, we see order, constants, and systems that work
                perfectly together. The stability and constants found in those
                parts of the Existence Line are perfect and precise.

                But why is this notion important for our discussion, where we

                because, if you observe the Existence Line once more, the place
                where there is chaos needs a proper system. So, if such a
                designer does exist, then it must have provided the ideal system
                which gives answer to 'The central questions' we asked earlier.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Time is one of the most profound anchors of existence. Though
                modern science have revealed the relativistic nature of time,
                showing that it bends and shifts under the laws of physics, this
                should not diminish its significance in human life.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3.2 Concepts of Time</h3>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Lets clarify some concepts of time to avoid any confusion about
                Direction of time:
                <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    <strong>What is time, exactly;</strong> Physicists define
                    time as the progression of events from the past to the
                    present into the future. Basically, if a system is
                    unchanging, it is timeless. Time can be considered to be the
                    fourth dimension of reality, used to describe events in
                    three-dimensional space. It is not something we can see,
                    touch, or taste, but we can measure its passage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    <strong>Time Dilation; </strong> a concept where the time
                    between events becomes longer (dilated) the closer one
                    travels to the speed of light. Moving clocks run more slowly
                    than stationary clocks, with the effect becoming more
                    pronounced as the moving clock approaches light speed.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Arrow of time; </strong>
                    physics equations work equally well whether time is moving
                    forward into the future (positive time) or backward into the
                    past (negative time.) However, time in the natural world has
                    one direction, called the arrow of time.

                last 300,000 years. As per the condition of sun, after 1 billion
                years it would become a gas giant making the earth un habitable.

                Above mentioned facts might not matter to you as a human being

                  <li>
                    <strong>Birth</strong>: Like yourself , everything had
                    beginning in this Universe and even the Universe itself had
                    a beginning.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Death</strong>: Everything has a expiry date, you
                    will also soon will face this extinction.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Human Innate Dispositions</strong>: There are some
                    common needs between all humans beings, any rulings or laws
                    against these dispositions simply cannot work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Existence</strong>: On observing 'The Line of
                    Existence', the complexity at each level and the order in
                    the Universe, the similitude of design from a micro to macro
                    level hints strongly the existence a single designer.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Time</strong>: The limited nature of time, reminds
                    everyone about the expiry date and produces
                    <strong>Cognitive Dissonance</strong> in mind to find
                    meaningful purpose and direction in this life.

                Looking back over the last two millennia, humanity witnessed
                staggering developments, technology, governance systems,
                medicine, political structures, industrial growth, and deeper
                understanding of the natural world through biology, chemistry,

                Knowledge became the catalyst for technological leaps and better
                living standards. But these gains came at a heavy cost: two
                catastrophic World Wars (1914–1945). These wars, while
                destructive, also accelerated advancements in medicine,
                engineering, and communication.

                In their aftermath, the post-war international order emerged,
                building institutions like the United Nations, WHO, and IMF,
                bodies intended to stabilize global relations, though not
                without bias or hidden agendas.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The advent of nuclear weapons reshaped geopolitics. Fear of
                mutual annihilation forced superpowers to negotiate rather than
                escalate, preventing another world war. Large-scale violence

                      Yes, we need God because infinite regression does not lead

                      Yes, we are not appealing to a "God of the gaps." In fact,
                      each law and each constant we find in any field of study
                      implies the existence of a designer behind it.

                      No idea. One thing is certain: since space-time is the
                      creation of God, He is outside of it, just like a software
                      developer doesn't live inside the software.

                      night, and many similar signs, we need to understand the
                      purpose of creation. This requires further study of the
                      current world and a search for that purpose. And, that is
                      our next step so strap in we are going for hunting the

                The need for Comparative study of Religions
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, we are at a thrilling yet daunting crossroads, forced to
                examine the systems and religions that dominate the 21st
                century.{" "}
                <b>
                  But, we now have clarity on Human Innate Dispositions, God's
                  attributed and Oneness of God through objective unbiased
                  research and logical reasoning.
                </b>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                We have one more challenge called "Cognitive Bias". The rigid
                separation of religion and state adds layers of complexity, and
                the modern trend of portraying religion as nothing more than
                "backward thinking" has created a hostile climate. These
                Cognitive Biases don't just discourage open dialogue, they
                actively choke the oxygen needed for unbiased, honest research.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Still, we must proceed. First, we will explore religions
                broadly, then compare them, and finally, take a deep dive into
                the one that offers the most relevant and sustainable framework
                for the world of 2025.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                But even if we discover the "right" religion or philosophy, our
                work doesn't end there. We will have to scour history for
                examples of systems that were successfully woven into everyday
                life, systems that genuinely solved the issues of chaos and are
                inline with.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8">
                And this will not be easy, because the current global framework,
                often referred to as the "New World Order," has been masterful
                at burying or erasing any competing alternative before it has
                the chance to take root. This is not just research, it's a
                battle for truth under layers of suppression.

              <p className="mb-6">
                After looking into human history, we find that our recorded data
                begins around 3500 BC. Yet, we must remember that Homo sapiens
                have walked this planet for 200,000–300,000 years, according to
                fossil evidence. For that vast prehistoric span, we have no
                written records, no clear window into how our ancestors lived,
                thought, and organized themselves.

                From 3500 BC to 2025 AD, a wide variety of religions emerged:

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> After an in-depth study using the
                above parameters, we conclude that the only religion which fully
                answers all the questions raised earlier in the "New Community"
                scenario, and which fulfills the criteria for the attributes of
                God without ambiguity, is Islam.

            <p className="mb-8">
              We have found the religion which fulfills the criteria perfectly.
              But the real question remains: How can it solve today's problems,
              and how can it possibly be implemented in the complex reality of
              2025?

                Conclusion
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-8">
                We have reached the conclusion that the current system is
                especially designed to keep you in the state of ignorance and
                exploit you with their own agenda.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, we have an understanding of how exactly we reached this
                state of affairs.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have understood the reality of Objective Morality. The
                reality of the existence of God. The reality of the purpose of
                creation. The reality of the purpose of life.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have found the true religion. The true religion that
                solves today's problems, and that can be implemented in the
                complex reality of 2025.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have the mental clarity on the current affairs, the
                conflicting ideologies and no more confusion regarding what is
                right and what is wrong. This clarity is very much needed in
                these tough times.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope you have found
                the mental peace you were looking for.

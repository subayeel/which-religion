              There are around 8 billion people in the world, including you.
              Everyone has their own goals and objectives in life, but these are
              often shaped by where they live and whom they interact with.
              However, there are certain things that are common to all of us.

            <p className="mb-8">
              For example, a mother's love for her child, the attraction toward

              desire for peace and stability in both personal and professional
              life, these are universal feelings.

            <p className="mb-8">
              There are many such innate desires that are common among humans,
              regardless of their location or mentality. My argument is that
              these innate feelings and the motivation to bring peace and
              prosperity into one's life led to the creation of communities,
              groups of people living together and supporting one another.
              However, this can sometimes become problematic, leading to the
              need for rules, which were established by the responsible members
              of the community.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              While I have mentioned the positive desires of humans, the issue
              arises with desires that drive individuals to break the rules set
              by the community, for example, the desire for power, respect, and
              wealth. These lead to many problems. Communities become divided
              over which rules are best, and eventually, a single community
              splits into multiple parts.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              This gives rise to different countries, languages, philosophies,
              religions, castes, and so on. Each group believes they are on the
              right path. This belief continues for generations. A child follows
              the path of the parent, and the biases instilled in the child's
              mind become so deeply rooted that it becomes almost impossible for
              them to question their inherited way of life.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Differences in customs, rituals, ethics, and rules can coexist.
              However, the consequence of this is subjective morality, which
              history has repeatedly shown cannot truly coexist. Time and again,
              one group declares war on another because they disagree on moral
              grounds. Each person believes their version of morality is true,
              often worsening the situation, whether due to negative desires or
              not.

                This is the Line of Existence. If you are a person of knowledge,
                you will be able to understand exactly where there is chaos and
                where there is order.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Let me elaborate further: On the Existence Line, if we go before
                Human, we see order, constants, and systems that work well
                together. Similarly, if we go after Country, we see stability.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The stability and constants found in those parts of the
                Existence Line are so perfect and detailed that humans have
                convinced themselves there must be a designer behind them. It is
                common sense to conclude the existence of a designer after
                seeing a perfect design. Thus, we have multiple religions and
                philosophies, each claiming they have a message from this
                designer.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                But why is this notion important for our discussion, where we
                are trying to figure out a stable system? It is important
                because, if you observe the Existence Line once more, the place
                where there is chaos needs a proper system. So, if such a
                designer does exist, then it must have provided the ideal
                system.

                The Crossroads
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, we are at a thrilling yet daunting crossroads, forced to
                examine the systems and religions that dominate the 21st
                century. The stakes are high, and the complexity is staggering.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                To truly grasp the matter, we must plunge fearlessly into the
                depths of existing systems that attempt to answer life's most
                profound questions, religions and philosophies. But in 2025, the
                challenge is greater than ever. The rigid separation of religion
                and state adds layers of complexity, and the modern trend of
                portraying religion as nothing more than "backward thinking" has
                created a hostile climate. These attitudes don't just discourage
                open dialogue, they actively choke the oxygen needed for
                unbiased, honest research.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Still, we must proceed. First, we will explore religions
                broadly, then compare them, and finally, take a deep dive into
                the one that offers the most relevant and sustainable framework
                for the world of 2025.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                But even if we discover the "right" religion or philosophy, our
                work doesn't end there. We will have to scour history for
                examples of systems that were successfully woven into everyday
                life, systems that genuinely solved the issues of chaos and
                instability outlined earlier. And this will not be easy, because
                the current global framework, often referred to as the "New
                World Order," has been masterful at burying or erasing any
                competing alternative before it has the chance to take root.
                This is not just research, it's a battle for truth under layers
                of suppression.

                After looking into human history, we find that our recorded data
                begins around 3500 BC. Yet, we must remember that Homo sapiens
                have walked this planet for 200,000–300,000 years, according to
                fossil evidence. For that vast prehistoric span, we have no
                written records, no clear window into how our ancestors lived,
                thought, and organized themselves.

                We are witnessing the cracks of the "New World Order" in 2025.
                It is failing at the most fundamental level — meeting the basic
                physiological needs of human beings. Inflation is pushing

                An interest-based economy traps the poor in perpetual debt while
                making the wealthy even richer. The judicial system bends toward
                those with money and power. Women are objectified in marketing
                and entertainment, reduced to tools for profit. Family
                structures are collapsing, children are being exploited, and

                hidden hands. Mainstream media, owned by elites, spins

                The Rise of the New World Order
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-8">
                Looking back over the last two millennia, humanity witnessed
                staggering developments, technology, governance systems,
                medicine, political structures, industrial growth, and deeper
                understanding of the natural world through biology, chemistry,
                physics, and mathematics.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Knowledge became the catalyst for technological leaps and better
                living standards. But these gains came at a heavy cost: two
                catastrophic World Wars (1914–1945). These wars, while
                destructive, also accelerated advancements in medicine,
                engineering, and communication.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                In their aftermath, the post-war international order emerged,
                building institutions like the United Nations, WHO, and IMF,
                bodies intended to stabilize global relations, though not
                without bias or hidden agendas.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The advent of nuclear weapons reshaped geopolitics. Fear of
                mutual annihilation forced superpowers to negotiate rather than
                escalate, preventing another world war. Large-scale violence
                declined, but small-scale conflicts never vanished.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The discovery of antibiotics dramatically improved public
                health. Meanwhile, the discovery of crude oil, though sparking
                resource-driven wars, especially in the Middle East, fueled the
                internal combustion engine, revolutionizing transportation and
                industry.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The industrial age transformed work life, drawing masses into
                factories. Later, the advent of the Internet shattered
                communication barriers and democratized access to information.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                These factors undeniably improved life, better health, political
                stability, organized governance, and technological abundance.
                Yet, success came with its own trap: the population boom. Longer
                lifespans and fewer conflicts swelled human numbers, demanding
                new food systems. The Green Revolution answered with high-yield
                crops, synthetic fertilizers, and mechanization.

              <p className="mb-6">
                But beneath these visible changes, hidden structural shifts were
                being engineered, often unnoticed amidst the noise of wars and

                <p className="mb-8">
                  There are nearly 198 countries, most of whose borders were
                  drawn by the British Empire to sow future conflict. In 2025
                  the consequences of this divide and rule policy are clearer
                  than ever.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-8">
                  But the question remains. If rulers know that these borders
                  are artificial, why do they not erase them, unite with
                  neighboring nations and eliminate animosity?
                </p>

                <p className="mb-8">
                  The answer is complex. History shows us that those who tried
                  to unite nations and erase artificial lines were swiftly
                  destroyed by forces we now recognize.

                Conclusion

              <p className="mb-8">
                We have reached the conclusion that the current system is
                especially designed to keep you in the state of ignorance and
                exploit you with their own agenda.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, we have an understanding of how exactly we reached this
                state of affairs.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have understood the reality of Objective Morality. The
                reality of the existence of God. The reality of the purpose of
                creation. The reality of the purpose of life.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have found the true religion. The true religion that
                solves today's problems, and that can be implemented in the
                complex reality of 2025.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                Now, you have the mental clarity on the current affairs, the
                conflicting ideologies and no more confusion regarding what is
                right and what is wrong. This clarity is very much needed in
                these tough times.

              <p className="mb-8">
                Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope you have found
                the mental peace you were looking for.
